# Contributing for this project.

> First of all, welcome to contribute to this project!

This is a project for a `student union`. We are glad to tell you that we have published one release to use in the school.

Whatever your shcool is, all of you can use this project if you want. It is simple to configurate, and use.

The source code is in the `src` folder, and the backend is `src/main.ts`, `src/preload.ts`, and `src/modules/**/*`. The front end is in `src/pages`.

I used `electron` to be the runtime. Also, I used `build`, `serve` script to dev / build.

If there is a bug, you can publish a issue. We have 2 options for issues(bug, feature). You can write the details there.

If you have some ideas of the code, you can publish a `pull request`. We are grateful for all of the contributings.

Whatever you are, please use `pr` to publish code for the main.
