# Here are the tests for back-end APIs.

Usage:

1. Write tests via `*.test.ts`. **Don't use** `*.spec.ts` because we also use `cypress` to test front-end. We want different names between `FE` and `BE`.
2. We use `ts-jest` to make type asserts or sth.
3. When you want to add some products or refact a piece of code, _PLEASE MUST WRITE TESTS_ before you do.
